# Task Management System

## Overview
This project is a [brief description of the project], designed using React, Redux for state management, and integrated with REST APIs for data handling. The application follows best practices for security and scalability.

## Features
- User authentication with JWT
- User register with a otp
- User login with password, email and a google recaptcha
- Logout
- Update profile included with (name, username, add bio and add image)
- Reset Password and forgot password
- Task management system(CRUD operation)
- API integration with Redux
- Secure data handling

## State Management
### Redux Setup
This project uses **Redux Toolkit** for efficient state management and API integration. The `redux` store handles global state, including authentication, tasks, and user profile data.

### Key Redux Features
- **Slices**: The application is divided into slices (e.g., `authSlice`, `taskSlice`).
- **Redux Thunk for async API calls**: Middleware for handling asynchronous operations like login, fetching tasks, etc.
- **Selector functions**: For accessing specific parts of the state efficiently.

# Task Management Backend Setup

## üöÄ Installation & Setup Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jhimi01/task-management-server.git
cd task-management-server
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies  
```sh
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables  
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
- The required environment variables will be shared separately.  
- Copy and paste the provided values into your `.env` file.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Database  
- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.  
- Update the `.env` file with your local `DATABASE_URL`.  
- Run the following command to apply database migrations:  
  ```sh
  npx prisma migrate dev --name init
  ```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Server  
```sh
nodemon server.ts
```
Your backend should now be running locally! üöÄ
